# 2 Cars Game
A "2 Cars" mobile game clone, made with Unity, for the purpose of learning.

## Description
After learning the basics of Unity, I thought I would learn a lot by building a clone of some simple game. Indeed I learned and explored a bunch of Unity and general game dev basic skills during the process of making this game.

## Help me learn and improve
If you are an experienced Unity developer, or C# developer I would be very glad to recieve comments and review about my project and code. Help me learn :)
